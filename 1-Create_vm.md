### 1. Create new VM

> *What is a VM? What is virtualization?*
> - A Virtual Machine is a software that emulates a physical computer system, allowing you to run other OSs on your machine with its own isolated environment. This is done by creating a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that manages the hardware resources of the physical machine and allocates them to the virtual machines.

> - A containers is a lightweight and portable application that packages an applicacitons and its dependencies into a single unit. These units can run on any machine that has the necessary container runtime environment. Container share the underlying OS kernel of the host machine. They are used to deploy and manage microservices applications. They can be created and managed using container orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which simplifies the process of deploying and managing containerized applications.

We need
- tool: Oracle VirtualBox
- files: Debian ISO image
  - Download the latest stable Debian ISO image from debian.org/download. Better to save it in your personal `sgoinfre` folder.

Open VirtualBox and create **new** VM.

Give the VM a **name**, a **location**, a type and a version.
- name: `Born2beroot`, for example
- location: inside your `sgoinfre` folder`sgoinfre/42login/vmdirname`
- type: linux
- version: debian

Reserve some **RAM** memory for the VM. 1024 MB is good.

Create a virtual **Hard disk** *now*.
- type: VDI (Virtual Disk Image)
- storage: select `dynamically allocated` so the allocation is done as is used until reaching the limit
- location: give the vdi a location `42login/vmdirname/Born2beroot/Born2beroot.vdi`
- size: `12GB` as recommended or `30GB` if we are doing the âœ¨bonusâœ¨ (the manual partitions need 30GB).
```
ðŸ”¹General
name: Born2beroot
SO: Debian
ðŸ”¹System
mem: 1024 MB
boot order: disquette, optic, hard disk
acc: ..
ðŸ”¹Display ...
ðŸ”¹Storage
controller: IDE, master secondary IDE: [optic unit] Empty
controller SATA, SATA port 0: Born2beroot.vdi (Normal, 12GB)
ðŸ”¹Audio ...
```

Almost done, now lets go to `Settings` >> `Storage` and add the image to the VM.
	- `Controller IDE` >> `ðŸ’¿ Empty`
	- select an optic unit from file on disk: the downloaded ISO image

> *Selecting the ISO Image as Optical Unit...*
> - Once the virtual hard disk is created, we can attach the Debian ISO image to the VM as an optical drive. This will allow the virtual machine to boot from the ISO image and install Debian. "optical drive" is used to simulate the presence of a CD/DVD drive, as if you had inserted a real installation disc.

Finally you can **start** the VM and begin to install the OS.
