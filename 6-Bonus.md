### 6. Bonus

#### I. WordPress and services
We want a functional WordPress site with Lighttpd, MariaDB and PHP.

> ðŸŒ³
> 
> WordPress is a popular open-source content management system (CMS)
> - IT allows users to create and manage websites and blogs.
> - It is built on PHP and uses a MySQL or MariaDB database to store content and configurations.
> - It provides a user-friendly interface, a wide range of themes and plugins, and flexibility.
> - It is a popular choice for both beginners and experienced web developers.
>
> To set up a WordPress site, we need the following componenents:
> - A **web server** to serve the site. (Apache and Nginx are commonly used web servers. We have to use Lighttpd).
> - WordPress is written in **PHP**, so we need a PHP runtime installed to execute PHP.
> - A **database server** to store its content and configuration.
> - **WordPress** files (from the official website) to store in the server.
> - A **web browser** to access and interact with your WordPress site (we'll use a host browser)

##### ðŸ”¸ Web server: Lighttpd
- Install it `sudo apt install`.
- Allow connection on port 80 `sudo ufw allow 80`. (use `sudo ufw status` to check)
- Forward the port
  - go to VM >> `Settings` >> `Network` >> `Adapter 1` >> `Advanced` >> `Port Forwarding`.
  - Type `http://127.0.0.1:8080` or `http://localhost:8080` in your host browser. You should see a Lighttpd "placeholder page".

> ðŸŒ³
> 
> Lighttpd
> - It is an open-source web server designed for speed, efficiency, and flexibility.
> - It uses an event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling many simultaneous connections with low resource usage
> - It supports URL rewriting, allowing administrators to configure clean and user-friendly URLs.
> - Its design is modular, allowing administrators to enable or disable specific modules based on their requirements.
> - It is well-suited for scenarios where resource efficiency and high performance are critical, such as serving static content, handling a large number of concurrent connections, or acting as a reverse proxy.  

##### ðŸ”¸ WordPress
- In order to install WP, we need wget and zip.
- Change directory `cd /var/www` to install WP here.
- Get the download link for the latest version of WP at [wordpress.org/download](https://wordpress.org/download/), choose zip format.
- Download WP with wget, unzip the package and rename paths.
- give `html` permissions: 755 (rwx for owner user, r-x for group and others)
```
$ sudo apt install wget zip
$ cd /var/www
$ sudo wget https://es.wordpress.org/latest-es_ES.zip
$ sudo unzip latest-es_ES.zip
$ sudo mv html/ html_old/
$ sudo mv wordpress/ html
$ sudo chmod -R 755 html
```

> ðŸŒ³
> 
> `wget` is a command-line utility to download files from the web
>
> `zip` is a command-line utility used for compressing and archiving files and directories in a ZIP format

##### ðŸ”¸ Database: MariaDB
- Install it with apt.
- Then do the MySQL secure installation.

```shell
$ sudo apt install mariadb-server
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

> ðŸŒ³
> 
> MariaDB
> 
> It is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
> Its goal is to remain highly compatible with MySQL while providing additional features, performance improvements, and enhanced security.
>
> `mysql_secure_installation`
> - It is a script provided with MySQL and MariaDB that helps to secure the installation by performing various security-related tasks. The configuration includes:
>   - If there is no root password set, the script will prompt you to set a password for the root user >> No (no password) or Yes (and provide the password). Saying No is OK.
>   - It asks whether we want to use `unix_socket` authentication. This would allow the root (local only) to access without password, authentication would be based on the user's OS credentials rather than a password. >> No
>   - It lets you remove anonymous users, which would connect without providing any credentials. >> Yes
>   - It lets you disallow remote login for the root user, adding a layer of security >> Yes
>   - It lets you remove test databases >> Yes
>   - At last it asks to reload privilege tables to make the changes take effect immediately >> Yes

```
Switch to unix_socket authentication? â†’ N
Change the root password? â†’ N
Remove anonymous users? â†’ Y
Disallow root login remotely? â†’ Y
Remove test database and access to it? â†’ Y
Reaload privilege tables now? â†’ Y
```
- Once MariaDB is installed, create both a DB and a user for WordPress to use.
  - Let's enter "mariadb mode".
  - The DB can be named as you wish.
  - Create the user (the below instruction creates a user with the username 'login' who can connect only from localhost and has the password '12345')
  - Grant the user privileges (all) for the new DB.
  - Use "flush" to refresh the privileges and get last changes.
```
$ mariadb
mdb > CREATE DATABASE my_wp_database;
mdb > SHOW DATABASES;
mdb > CREATE USER 'login'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '12345';
mdb > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wp_database.* TO 'gemartin'@'localhost';
mdb > FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mdb > exit
$
```
##### ðŸ”¸ PHP
> ðŸŒ³
>
> PHP is a server-side scripting language widely used for web development, and a PHP runtime provides the necessary infrastructure for interpreting and executing PHP code.
>
> When you set up a web server to run PHP, you need to install the PHP runtime on the server.
> We need two packages: `php-cgi` and `php-mysql`.
> - `php-cgi`: PHP Common Gateway Interface.
>   - It is a CGI executable, a way to run PHP scripts via CGI.
>   - It is a binary executable that implements the CGI protocol for PHP scripts.
>   - The web server uses it to execute the script and generate dynamic content when a request is received.
>   - It is one way to integrate PHP with web servers.
> - `pdp-mysql`
>   - It is a PHP extension, adding MySQL-specific functionality to PHP.
>   - It provides functions and features for PHP to connect to a MySQL database, execute queries, and manage data.

- Install what is necessary to execute PHP web applications and to allow them to communicate with databases.
  - `sudo apt install php-cgi php-mysql`.

##### ðŸ”¸ WordPress configuration
WordPress settings are configured with the file `wp-config.php`.
- Go to `/var/www/html`.
- Use the sample provided to create the config file.
- Start to edit it.

```shell
$ cd /var/www/html
$ cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
$ sudo nano wp-config.php
```
- Edit the following with the MariaDB database and user we created.
  - DB_NAME: `'my_wp_database'`
  - BD_user: `'login'`
  - DB_password: `'12345'`
- Enable the FastCGI module in the Lighttpd web server to improve the performance of PHP scripts. FastCGI is a protocol for interfacing web servers with external programs.
  - `sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi`
- Enable FastCGI support specifically for PHP scripts.
  - `sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi-php`
- Save changes with `sudo service lighttpd force-reload`.
- To finish the WordPress installation, go to the host browser and type `localhost` (it will enter [localhost/wp-admin/install.php](localhost/wp-admin/install.php) and fill the form.
  - Site title
  - user name (a new user for wordpress?)
  - password
  - email (42 email)
- Select `Installl WordPress` and we are done!


- Access `localhost` again and we'll see a working WP site. OR `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- To make changes access the admin panel at `localhost/wp-admin` and login.


#### II. A useful service of your choice: vsftpd

> We can't choose NGINX or Apache2. What are NGINX and Apache2?
> 
> open-source web servers.
> - Apache has been a dominant player in the web server space for a long time and is well-suited for a wide range of scenarios.
> - Apache supports a variety of features, including the ability to serve static and dynamic content, handle virtual hosts, and provide support for various modules and extensions
> - Nginx is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server.
> - Nginx is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and efficient, making it particularly suitable for serving static content and handling a large number of concurrent connections.
>
Chat Server (Matrix Synapse)
We can choose whatever we want..
- A different web server like LiteSpeed
- Fail2ban, a security measure for SSH against brute force attacks.
- A database Server (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- A File Server (vsftpd or ProFTPD)
- A Version Control Server (Git)
- A chat server (Matrix Synapse)
- A monitoring service (Prometheus + Grafana)
- A VPN Server (OpenVPN or WireGuard)
- A Container Orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes)
- A Personal Cloud (Nextcloud or ownCloud)
- A Game Server (Minecraft, Factorio, etc.)

We are going to do a file server (with vsftpd) and a VPN server (with OpenVPN).

#### ðŸ”¹ vsftpd (File Server)
Let's go through setting up a file server using vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Daemon) first.

1. Install vsftpd:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install vsftpd
```
2. Configure vsftpd:

- Open the configuration file for editing:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
```
- Ensure the following configurations are set or modify them accordingly:

```conf
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
```
- These settings disable anonymous access, allow local users to login, enable write permissions, and chroot users to their home directory.

3. Restart vsftpd:

```bash
sudo service vsftpd restart
```
4. Create User Accounts:

- Create a new user for FTP access:

```bash
sudo adduser ftpuser
```
- Set a password for the new user.

5. Test FTP Access:

- Use an FTP client (e.g., FileZilla) to connect to your server using the created user credentials. Connect to the server's IP address or hostname.

#### ðŸ”¹ OpenVPN (VPN Server):
1. Install OpenVPN:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvpn
```
2. Configure OpenVPN:

- Copy the sample configuration files:

```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn/
sudo gzip -d /etc/openvpn/server.conf.gz
```
- Edit the configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf
```
- Ensure the following lines are uncommented or add them:

```conf
push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222"
push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"
```
These lines redirect all client traffic through the VPN and set DNS options.

- Generate a static key for additional security:

```bash
openvpn --genkey --secret /etc/openvpn/static.key
```
3. Start OpenVPN:

```bash
sudo service openvpn start
```
- Ensure OpenVPN starts at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable openvpn
```
4.Generate Client Configuration:

- On the server, generate a client configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client.ovpn
```
- Add the following content, replacing your_server_ip with your server's IP address:

```conf
client
dev tun
proto udp
remote your_server_ip 1194
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
ca ca.crt
cert client.crt
key client.key
remote-cert-tls server
```
- Save the file.

5. Securely Transfer Client Configuration:

- Transfer the client.ovpn, client.crt, client.key, and static.key files to the client machine securely.
6. Connect from Client:

- On the client, use an OpenVPN client to connect using the provided configuration.
